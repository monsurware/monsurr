My name is Ottun Monsuru Oluwatoyin, from lagos state and i lived in i amikorodu, the trenches part of lagos nigeria. I am a passionate and driven 300-level student of Computer Science at Lagos State University, under the Faculty of Science. With a strong interest in technology and problem-solving, I am currently undertaking a six-month SIWES (Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme) program at SP System and Net Solution, where I am gaining hands-on experience in the field of IT and computing.

During my time at SP System and Net Solution, I have been exposed to real-world applications of computing. This experience has helped me build a practical foundation that complements my academic knowledge and has improved my ability to work in a professional environment.

I have a growing interest in programming, web development, and system administration. I am currently working to improve my skills in languages such as Python and JavaScript, and I enjoy learning about how technology can be used to solve everyday problems. I am also deeply interested in software development and hope to explore these areas further.

I consider myself hardworking, curious, and always eager to learn new things. My goal is to become a skilled software developer who creates meaningful tech solutions, especially in ways that benefit businesses and communities across Africa.

Outside academics, I enjoy playing games, travelling, and staying updated with the latest innovations in the tech world and partying.
